# Investing by Age: What AI Suggests for Canadians in Their 20s, 30s, 40s…

Your investment strategy shouldn't be a one-size-fits-all solution. As you move through life, your financial goals, income, and risk tolerance will change, and your investment strategy should adapt accordingly. The way a 25-year-old invests for the long term should look very different from how a 45-year-old prepares for retirement.

But how do you know what strategy is right for you at each stage of your life? In the past, this has been a matter of consulting with a financial advisor and relying on general rules of thumb. But in 2025, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is offering a much more personalized and data-driven approach to age-based investing.

This article will explore how your investment strategy should evolve as you age and how AI-powered platforms can help you create a customized plan for your 20s, 30s, 40s, and beyond.




## Investing in Your 20s: The Age of Growth

Your 20s are a time of incredible opportunity when it comes to investing. You have the most valuable asset on your side: time. With a long time horizon until retirement, you can afford to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns. This is the time to focus on growth.

**Traditional Approach:** A traditional advisor would likely recommend a portfolio heavily weighted towards stocks, with a smaller allocation to bonds. They would also advise you to start saving in your RRSP and TFSA.

**The AI-Powered Strategy:** An AI-powered platform can take this a step further. It will not only recommend a growth-oriented portfolio but will also help you optimize your savings strategy based on your specific circumstances.

*   **TFSA First:** For most people in their 20s, income is relatively low. An AI platform will likely recommend prioritizing your TFSA over your RRSP. The tax deduction from an RRSP is less valuable at a lower income, and the tax-free withdrawals from a TFSA offer more flexibility for short-term goals like a down payment or a wedding.
*   **Automated Investing:** An AI platform can help you set up automated contributions to your investment accounts. This “pay yourself first” approach ensures that you are consistently investing, even when life gets busy.
*   **Low-Cost Diversification:** AI platforms typically use low-cost, globally diversified ETFs to build their portfolios. This gives you exposure to a wide range of markets and helps to reduce your risk.




## Investing in Your 30s: Balancing Growth and Responsibility

Your 30s are often a time of major life changes. You may be getting married, buying a house, or starting a family. Your income is likely higher than it was in your 20s, but you also have more financial responsibilities. Your investment strategy needs to reflect this new reality.

**Traditional Approach:** A traditional advisor would likely recommend a slightly more conservative portfolio than in your 20s, with a larger allocation to bonds. They would also advise you to start thinking about life insurance and saving for your children's education.

**The AI-Powered Strategy:** An AI-powered platform can help you navigate the complexities of this life stage with a more holistic and personalized approach.

*   **RRSP Optimization:** With a higher income, the tax deduction from an RRSP becomes more valuable. An AI platform can analyze your income and tax situation to determine the optimal amount to contribute to your RRSP to maximize your tax savings. It can also factor in the Canada Child Benefit (CCB), as RRSP contributions can increase the amount of CCB you receive.
*   **Goal-Based Planning:** An AI platform can help you create separate investment goals for your different financial priorities, such as retirement, your children's education (through an RESP), and a major purchase. It can then recommend a customized portfolio for each goal based on its time horizon and risk level.
*   **Debt Management:** An AI platform can help you create a plan to pay down your mortgage and other debts while still saving for the future. It can analyze your interest rates and cash flow to determine the most efficient way to allocate your money.




## Investing in Your 40s: The Home Stretch to Retirement

Your 40s are a critical decade for retirement savings. You are likely at the peak of your earning years, and retirement is no longer a distant dream. It's time to get serious about building your nest egg.

**Traditional Approach:** A traditional advisor would recommend a more conservative portfolio, with an even larger allocation to bonds and other fixed-income investments. They would also advise you to review your retirement plan and make sure you are on track to meet your goals.

**The AI-Powered Strategy:** An AI-powered platform can provide a much more detailed and data-driven analysis of your retirement readiness.

*   **Retirement Projections:** An AI platform can run thousands of simulations to project the future value of your portfolio and determine the probability of you reaching your retirement goals. This can give you a much clearer picture of where you stand and what you need to do to stay on track.
*   **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Strategies:** An AI platform can help you create a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy for retirement. It can analyze your different investment accounts (RRSP, TFSA, non-registered) and recommend the most tax-effective way to draw them down in retirement.
*   **Risk Management:** As you get closer to retirement, preserving your capital becomes more important. An AI platform can help you manage your risk by gradually shifting your portfolio to a more conservative allocation. It can also use sophisticated risk management techniques to protect your portfolio from market downturns.



## Investing in Your 50s and Beyond: Preservation and Income

As you enter your 50s and approach retirement, your investment strategy should shift from growth to preservation and income generation. This is the time to protect what you've built and prepare for the transition to retirement.

**Traditional Approach:** A traditional advisor would recommend a conservative portfolio with a heavy allocation to bonds and other fixed-income investments. They would also advise you to start thinking about your withdrawal strategy for retirement.

**The AI-Powered Strategy:** An AI-powered platform can help you navigate this critical transition with precision and confidence.

*   **Glide Path Optimization:** An AI platform can create a "glide path" that gradually shifts your portfolio from growth to income as you approach retirement. This helps to reduce your risk while still allowing for some growth potential.
*   **Retirement Income Planning:** An AI platform can help you create a comprehensive retirement income plan that takes into account all of your income sources, including CPP, OAS, employer pensions, and your investment accounts. It can then recommend the most tax-efficient way to draw down your savings.
*   **Longevity Planning:** With Canadians living longer than ever, there's a risk of outliving your savings. An AI platform can help you plan for a retirement that could last 30 years or more, ensuring that your money lasts as long as you do.

## The AI Advantage: Personalized Strategies for Every Stage

The beauty of AI-powered investing is that it can create a truly personalized strategy for your unique situation. Unlike the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional investing, AI can take into account your specific goals, income, family situation, and risk tolerance to create a strategy that is tailored just for you.

As you move through different stages of your life, your AI-powered platform can adapt and evolve with you, ensuring that your investment strategy is always aligned with your current needs and future goals.

## Your Investment Journey Starts Now

No matter what stage of life you're in, it's never too early or too late to start investing. With the power of AI, you can create a personalized investment strategy that grows and evolves with you throughout your life.

The key is to start where you are, with what you have, and let AI guide you on the path to financial success.
